    description:
      "La Fin Du Monde was one of the first truly world-class North American beers of the modern age. Cleaner than most Belgian Tripels and less sweet than a lot of the Americans, this one matches a burly 9% alcohol by volume with a mouthfeel lighter than most pale ales. A Champagne yeast finish gives it plenty of effervescence and just a touch of apple flavor on the back end. If you're looking for an easy drinking higher alcohol beer, you'd be hard pressed to do better.",
